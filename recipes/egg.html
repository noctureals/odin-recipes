    <h3>Soft Boiled Eggs for Ramen Recipe</h3>
        <p>Homemade ramen deserves the very best toppings. If you've got an immersion circulator, then you've already got what it takes to create those awesomely tender, custard-like onsen tamago that you get in fancypants restaurants like Momofuku Noodle Bar. Just cook your egg at 145째F (63째C) for about 45 minutes or so, and there you go. (And of course, you can always do it in a beer cooler).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water (about 8 ounces; 225g)</li>
            <li>1 cup sake (about 8 ounces; 225g)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce (about 4 ounces; 115g)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mirin (about 4 ounces; 115g)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar (about 3 1/2 ounces; 100g)</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, sake, soy, mirin, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until sugar is dissolved (see note). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Pierce fat end of each egg with a thumbtack to make a tiny hole. (This prevents them from cracking and eliminates the air bubble at the end.) Carefully lower eggs into water with a wire mesh spider or slotted spoon. Reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer (about 190째F/88째C). Cook for exactly 6 minutes. Drain hot water and carefully peel eggs under cold running water. (The whites will be quite delicate.)</li>
            <li>Transfer eggs to a bowl that just barely fits them all. Pour marinade on top until eggs are covered or just floating. Place a double layer of paper towels on top and press down until completely saturated in liquid to help keep eggs submerged and marinating evenly. Refrigerate and marinate at least 4 hours and up to 12. Discard marinade after 12 hours. Store eggs in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in ramen soup to serve.</li>
